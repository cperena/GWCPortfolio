    <h3>OBAMICON IN PYTHON</h3>
    <p>I created a python program than simulates the obamicon. You can see in the images that it takes the original image and changes the pixel colors. The program consists of a function that allows the user to choose the image that will be modified and a color changer. The program creates a list with the r,g,b info from each pixel in the image. It adds the three values and changes the pixel color depemding on the intensity. I worked with Lauren Young on this project. Partner programing was a good idea during this project due to the fact that we could bounce ideas off each other.
